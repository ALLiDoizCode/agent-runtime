# Story 28.3: Build Multi-Arch Aptos Docker Image (DEPRECATED)

## Deprecation Notice

**Status: DEPRECATED as of 2026-01-31**

This story was deprecated in favor of using public testnets (Aptos Testnet, XRP Testnet, Base Sepolia) instead of building and maintaining a multi-architecture Aptos Docker image.

**Reasons for deprecation:**
1. Building Aptos from source takes 30-90 minutes per architecture
2. Maintaining multi-arch CI infrastructure adds complexity
3. Public testnets provide production-like testing behavior
4. No Docker container management needed with testnet mode

**Replacement:**
- Story 28.3 (new): Add Public Testnet Configuration
- Story 28.4 (revised): Update Test Infrastructure for Testnets

**Artifacts retained (not in critical path):**
- `.github/workflows/build-aptos-image.yml` - May be useful for future local testing
- `docker/aptos/Dockerfile` - Reference implementation
- `docker/aptos/README.md` - Documentation

## Original Story Content (for reference)

The original story created a GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish multi-architecture Aptos Docker images. All tasks were completed but the image was never published to a registry before the pivot to public testnets.
