  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No external I/O, no user-controlled input, telemetry errors silenced. No attack surface."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Array.shift() and reduce() are O(n) but acceptable for expected record counts in hourly windows."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Non-blocking telemetry via try-catch. Math.max(0,...) prevents negative budgets. Warning flags reset correctly on pruning."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean single-responsibility class, well-documented interfaces with JSDoc, 100% test coverage, proper barrel exports."
