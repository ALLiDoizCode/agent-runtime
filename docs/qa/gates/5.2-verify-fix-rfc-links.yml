nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Read-only HTTP GET requests to public URLs. No authentication or sensitive data. Proper timeout handling."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test execution: ~2 seconds. Dedicated CI job prevents blocking. No performance regressions."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust test design with HTTP status + title validation. CI integration ensures continuous verification. Will catch future link rot immediately."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code documentation. Clear test structure. Easy to extend with new RFC links. No technical debt."

implementation_highlights:
  - "Discovered and resolved RFC URL migration issue (404 errors on old /rfcs/ paths)"
  - "Implemented comprehensive automated verification with title validation"
  - "Updated 8 documentation files across the project"
  - "Full CI integration with dedicated GitHub Actions job"
  - "Excellent developer documentation in completion notes"

recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding retry logic for transient network failures (optional enhancement)"
      refs: ["packages/connector/test/integration/rfc-links.test.ts"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Current implementation is solid; retry logic would provide marginal improvement for flaky network conditions"

commendations:
  - "Exemplary problem-solving: Discovered RFC URL migration and documented it thoroughly"
  - "Comprehensive solution: Automated verification prevents future link rot"
  - "Quality implementation: Clean test code with excellent documentation"
  - "Proactive CI integration: Ensures ongoing validation without manual effort"
  - "This is a model implementation that sets the standard for documentation quality"
