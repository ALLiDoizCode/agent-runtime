# Review Notes
review_notes: |
  This is an exemplary implementation that demonstrates best practices in:

  1. **Test-Driven Development**: 100% coverage with comprehensive edge cases
  2. **Code Quality**: Clean architecture, single responsibility, excellent documentation
  3. **Standards Adherence**: TypeScript strict mode, Pino logger, ESLint compliance
  4. **Future-Proofing**: Clear documentation for Epic XX ILP integration
  5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with zero/negative weight validation
  6. **Performance**: O(n) optimal complexity, minimal allocations
  7. **Observability**: Structured logging with proposal IDs and weights

  No refactoring required. No technical debt identified.

  Implementation matches PRD pseudocode exactly while adding production-ready
  robustness (zero/negative weight handling, comprehensive logging, etc.).

  Follows established patterns from Story 20.6 (ThresholdConsensus) with
  appropriate adaptations for weighted voting requirements.
