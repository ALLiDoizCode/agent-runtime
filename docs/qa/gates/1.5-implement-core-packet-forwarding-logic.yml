# Integration points for future stories
integration_notes: |
  Story 1.5 establishes critical integration points for Epic 2:
  - forwardToNextHop() method stub ready for BTP implementation
  - Logger interface compatible with Pino (Story 1.6 integration)
  - Correlation IDs enable distributed tracing
  - Structured logging supports telemetry (Epic 3)

  All acceptance criteria met with exceptional quality.
  No blocking issues identified.
  Ready for production deployment after Epic 2 BTP integration.
